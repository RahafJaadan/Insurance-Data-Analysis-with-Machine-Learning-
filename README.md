# Insurance-Data-Analysis-with-Machine-Learning 

This project focuses on analyzing insurance data using machine learning to predict outcomes with high accuracy. We employed data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning models to assess and improve prediction accuracy. 

## Project Overview
 The project involves:
 * **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Ensuring data quality and preparing it for modeling. 
 * **Data Visualization**: Using visualizations to understand data patterns and distributions. 
 * **Machine Learning Models**: Applying regression algorithms to predict outcomes and evaluate accuracy.

## Libraries Used 
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing. 
* **Seaborn and Matplotlib**: For visualizing data insights. 
* **Numpy**: For numerical operations. 
* **Scikit-Learn (sklearn)**: For model building and evaluation.

## Machine Learning Algorithms
We used the following regression algorithms to measure accuracy: 
* **RandomForestRegressor** 
* **LinearRegression**
* **KNeighborsRegressor**
* **DecisionTreeRegressor**
* **Support Vector Regressor(SVR)**

After evaluation, **RandomForestRegressor** provided the most accurate predictions for our dataset. 

## Getting Started 
To run this project: 

1. Clone the repository.
